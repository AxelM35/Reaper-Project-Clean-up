Reaper batch cleaner

A massive THANK YOU from GriffinSauce who started the code in JS. I've rewritten it in Python and added one or two features. I've mainly use AI as I'm a total noobie when it comes to coding.

THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. DO NOT USE IT IN A REAL CASE SCENARIO.

I would love folks who are real coders (not like myself) to help me test it out and maybe improve it. Please use the code freely!
